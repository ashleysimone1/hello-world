Hi! This is Ashley's hello-world lab. This is an introduction to git repositories and creating branches for editing code.
# About Me!

Hello! My name is *Ashley*. I am **22 years old** and I am from a city called ***Bridgeport, CT***. I became a *Marcy Lab Fellow* because the **traditional** college experience was completely **wrong for me**. Although I have gone to college and did fairly well in highschool, I am a *little* nervous about learning to be a **software engineer**. Scared nonetheless, I am *extremely* excited and feel *so welcomed* by the **Marcy** community. I know I can see it through to the end and ***can't wait*** to see what this year will bring.
